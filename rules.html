    <h2>Welcome to Counting Tiles!</h2>
    <img id="screenOne" src="images/s5.png" alt="screenshot" height="311px" width="289px">
    <h2>Objective: To strategically place tiles in an attempt to reach specific row values</h2>
    <h2>It's harder than it sounds!</h2>
    <p id="fl">The gameboard automatically starts with seven tiles placed. To achieve the needed row values, tiles can
        be
        placed on the gameboard, moved, or
        combined with each other. At game-start, randomly-generated tiles are placed in open spaces on
        the board every 25 seconds, and this time interval decreases as rows are completed. Additionally, the tile value
        distribution initially includes tiles with values between one and fourteen, inclusive. As rows are completed,
        tiles with larger values are incrementally added to the distribution. Forty is the largest possible tile
        value. </p>

    <h3>PLACING TILES</h3>
    <p>The currently-drawn tile appears adjacent to the gameboard. This tile can be placed in any open space on the
        board. Once placed, a new tile is drawn. To place a tile, click or tap an open space on the board.
    </p>

    <h3>MOVING TILES</h3>
    <p>Tiles can be moved to up, down, left, or right (not diagonally), but each tile can only be moved once. A moved
        tile can
        be subsequently combined, but it cannot be moved again. When a tile is
        moved, the currently-drawn tile is automatically discarded and a new tile is drawn. To move a tile on desktop or
        laptop, click and drag, dropping in the open space. If you are on a mobile device, click the tile that you would
        like to move (this will highlight it with a blue outline), and then click in the open space in which you would
        like it to be placed.</p>

    <h3>COMBINING TILES</h3>
    <p>Tiles can be combined with adjacent tiles of lower values by which they are evenly divisible. As a result
        of combining, the tile being combined takes on the quotient value of the combining operation. For example,
        tile A has a value of 10 and tile B has a value of 5. Tile A can be combined with tile B. Tile A now reflects
        the quotient value of 2. Once tiles are combined, they cannot be moved, but tiles can be combined without limit.
        As another example, tile A has a value of 8 and tile B has a value of 2. Tile A can be combined with tile B
        twice. The 8 becomes a 4, then, after combining again, the 4 becomes a 2. Each time a tile is combined, the
        currently-drawn tile is automatically discarded and a new tile is drawn. Tiles that share the same value cannot
        be combined, and a tile cannot be combined with a tile holding the value of one. To combine a tile on desktop or
        laptop, click and drag, dropping the tile on top of the tile with which you would like it to be combined. If you
        are on a mobile device, click the tile that you would
        like to combine (this will highlight it with a blue outline), and then click on the combining tile.</p>

    <h3>COMPLETING A ROW</h3>
    <p>For a row to be completed, it must be completely filled and the sum of the tile values in the row must be exactly
        the specified value. The cell at the end of each row displays the total tile values still needed in that row for
        the row to ben complete. When a row is completed, the tiles in the completed row are cleared and a bonus is
        unlocked. The bonuses can
        be used at any time in future gameplay and they unlock from top to bottom. If the first bonus goes unused, the
        second bonus gets unlocked when the next row is completed. Once unlocked, the bonuses can be used in any order.
        The "wild card" bonus is available only once per game.
    </p>

    <h3>TILE COLORS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Randomly-placed tiles have a rose-colored background.</li>
        <img id="c1" src="images/r3.png" alt="screenshot" height="97px" width="97px">
        <li>Manually-placed tiles have a beige background.</li>
        <img id="c2" src="images/7.png" alt="screenshot" height="97px" width="97px">
        <li>Moved tiles have a light blue background.</li>
        <img id="c3" src="images/13mvd.png" alt="screenshot" height="97px" width="97px">
        <li>Combined tiles have a darker blue background. It gets darker each time the tile is subsequently combined.
        </li>
        <img id="c4" src="images/10cmb.png" alt="screenshot" height="97px" width="97px">
    </ul>

    <h3>Scoring</h3>
    <p>As tiles are combined and the tile values on the gameboard are decreased, points are awarded according
        to the tile value savings. For example, tile A has a value of 10 and is combined with tile B that has
        a value of 5. Tile A now holds a tile value of 2, and 8 points are immediately awarded. Additionally, 350 points
        are awarded for each completed row.</p>

    <h3>Challenge mode</h3>
    <p>The default gameplay mode is called "challenge mode" and it plays as described throughout these rules. Toggling
        challenge mode to "off" before gamestart results in the same gameplay experience, just without the decreasing
        time
        interval between the placements of the random tiles. This more casual game mode is intended to be a more
        relaxing
        version of this fast-paced game.</p>

    <h3>Game end: The game ends when the board is completely full.</h3>
