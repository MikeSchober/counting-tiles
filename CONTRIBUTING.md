# Contributing to Counting Tiles

Improvements are welcome! Please read the following guidelines before submitting any changes.

## How to contribute
To contribute changes, fork the repo, create a new branch based on the `main` branch, make your improvements, then open a PR to `main`.

## Welcome changes
- gameplay functionality improvements that don’t have an impact on the core structure of the game (core structure meaning the game’s objective, rules, tile distribution, or fundamental gameplay). For example, a change that improves the way in which tiles move from space to space may be accepted, but a change that involves a modification to the number of rows on the gameboard would not.
- compatibility expansion
- logic enhancements
- bug fixes

## Changes that are not likely to be accepted
- changes to the core structure of the game (core structure meaning the game’s objective, rules, tile distribution, or fundamental gameplay)
- changes to the size of the gameboard
- game save and/or user profile functionality
- changes to code format or white space, or that are otherwise only aesthetic in nature
- changes that involve API calls to third-party APIs may not be accepted due to the complexity involved in determining data processing and privacy implications for end users

## Other requests
Please test your changes before submitting your pull request and please write a clear PR description that describes what is being changed/improved and why. Also, please use proper grammar and spelling, and please try to use clear remarks in your code where needed.

I’m still fairly new to JavaScript and to development in general, but I’m really excited to share this and to hopefully collaborate with others! If you have an idea for further collaboration, or if you have any feedback or questions, you can contact me at mike@mikeschober.dev

**Thank you for reading and for your interest in contributing!**
